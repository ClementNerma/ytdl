# Youtube Downloader

This program is a large wrapper for [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), a fork of [`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

It aims to improve videos downloading from Youtube and other platforms, and has a builtin synchronization feature to automatically update playlists.

It fits in a single binary with no external dependency other than `yt-dlp` itself.

Initially made to be used with my [AutoDotFiles](https://github.com/ClementNerma/AutoDotFiles).
